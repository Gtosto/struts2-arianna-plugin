The *strust^2^-arianna-plugin* is a simple but quite flexible plugin to render and manage a simple breadcrumb navigational bar.
It keep track of the executed action (storing them into session) to allow rendering of the breadcrumb.

== Features ==
 * An `@BreadCrumb` annotation to mark actions or methods that needs to be tracked
 * a simple breadcrumb tag to iterate over stored crumbs
 * configurable breadcrumb behaviour

== Requirements ==
 * Struts 2.x
 * Java 1.5+

The plugin make use of Java5 annotation to select which action should be tracked, so you need java 5;

== Installation ==
Just download the plugin from [http://code.google.com/p/struts2-arianna-plugin/downloads/list here] and put the jar into your application's `/WEB-INF/lib` directory.

== Usage ==
The breadcrumb functionality is provided by an interceptor which needs to be added to the action's interceptor stack.

{{{
<interceptor name="breadCrumbs" class="org.softwareforge.struts2.breadcrumb.BreadCrumbInterceptor">
  <param name="maxCrumbs">4</param>
  <param name="rewindMode">NEVER</param>
</interceptor>
}}}

You can configure the interceptor with the maximum crumbs to track and how it should handle duplicated crumbs (`rewindMode` parameter).

Once the breadCrumbs interceptor is part of your interceptor's stack, just annotate with `@BreadCrumb` the actions and/or methods that you want to track.

== Examples ==

{{{
public class ActionClass {

  @BreadCrumb("Action 1")
  public String action1() {
    // action's code
    ...
  }
	
  @BreadCrumb("Action 2")
  public String action2() {
    // action's code
    ...
  }

}}}
