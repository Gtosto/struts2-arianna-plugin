#summary parameters explanation

== Interceptor's parameters ==

|| *Parameter* || *Type* ||*Description* || *Default* ||
|| _`trail.maxCrumbs`_ || number || The maximum number of crumbs to keep stored. || `6` ||
|| _`trail.rewindMode`_ || String || The default rewind mode. Valid values are `NEVER` and `AUTO` || `AUTO` ||
|| _`trail.comparator`_ || String || The default comparator to use when checking for crumb equality. || `org.softwareforge.struts2.breadcrumb.NameComparator` ||

==== Rewind mode ===

The `rewindMode` parameter deals with duplicated crumbs.

==== NEVER ====
When the rewind mode is `NEVER` the plugin will _never_ rewind the _bread crumbs_ and it will allow the _bread crumbs trail_ to have duplicated crumbs.

==== AUTO ====
When the rewind mode is `AUTO` duplicated crumbs are not allowed. What _duplicated_ means depends by the comparator actually used (see below).
If you invoke an action that would create a crumb already existing the plugin will _rewind_ the _bread crumbs trail_ to _that_ crumb.

For example if the current bread crumb is 
{{{
Action1 > Action2 > Action3 > Action4
}}} 
and the invoked action creates the crumb `Action2` the trail will be rewound to 
{{{
Action1 > Action2
}}}
