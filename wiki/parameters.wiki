#summary parameters explanation

== Interceptor's parameters ==

|| *Parameter* || *Description* || *default* ||
|| _`maxCrumbs`_ || The maximum number of crumbs to keep stored. || `4` ||
|| _`rewind`_ || the default rewind mode. Valid values are `NEVER` and `AUTO` || `NEVER` ||

==== Rewind mode ===

The `rewind` parameter deals with duplicated crumbs.

==== NEVER ====
When the rewind mode is `NEVER` the plugin will _never_ rewind the breadcrumbs and it will allow the breadcrumbs' trail  to have duplicated crumbs.

==== AUTO ====
When the rewind mode is `AUTO` duplicated crumbs are not allowed.
If you invoke an action that would create a crumb already existing the plugin will _rewind_ the breadcrumb's trail to _that_ crumb.

For example if the current breadcrumb is 
{{{
Action1 > Action2 > Action3 > Action4
}}} 
and the invoked action creates the crumb `Action2` the trail will be rewound to 
{{{
Action1 > Action2
}}}
